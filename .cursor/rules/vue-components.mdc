# Vue 3 Conventions

- Prefer Composition API with `<script setup>` for new components.
- Use clear component names (PascalCase) and keep single-file components focused.
- Prefer Pinia for shared state; use provide/inject only for narrow, local concerns.
- Keep templates readable: extract complex expressions into computed properties or methods.
- Use kebab-case for custom events and props in templates when multi-word.
